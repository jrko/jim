  Create or update the project VISION.md — problem statement, target audience,
  competitive landscape, non-goals, and product north star. Use when the user
  invokes /jim:vision, asks about product direction, or wants to define what
  the project is and isn't. Do not use for technical architecture (/jim:arch),
  execution sequencing (/jim:roadmap), or scoping individual work items (/jim:spec).

# /jim:vision

Create or update the project's VISION.md through a section-by-section collaborative interview.

*(The `agent: pm` field in this frontmatter is a jim documentation convention, not a Claude Code routing mechanism.)*

## Process

### 1. Seed the conversation

Use `$ARGUMENTS` as a project name or topic hint. If empty, ask: "What project or product do you want to define a vision for?"

### 2. Read context

Read ARCHITECTURE.md from the project root if it exists — it's a locked constraint. Don't contradict technical decisions already made.

If missing, note conversationally: "No ARCHITECTURE.md yet — you might want to create one after this." Do not block.

### 3. Check for existing VISION.md

Read VISION.md from the project root.

- **Exists:** This is a differential update. Read the content. Tell the user: "I see an existing VISION.md. I'll walk through each section and suggest changes based on our conversation." Identify which sections are well-defined vs. which need work.
- **Does not exist:** Fresh creation. Proceed to interview.

### 4. Problem Statement & Solution Statement — wordsmith mode

These two sections use a structured format with sub-bullets. The wording matters — expect multiple revision rounds.

**Process for each:**

1. Explain the structured format before interviewing:
   - Problem Statement: ~50 word summary paragraph, then three bullets: **The Ideal** / **The Reality / Friction** / **The Consequence**
   - Solution Statement: summary paragraph, then three bullets: **The Mechanism** / **The Function** / **The Result**
2. Interview to understand the content (1-2 bounded questions, recursive drill-down on vague statements)
3. Draft the section with the structured sub-bullets
4. Present the draft and iterate on exact wording with the user
5. Do not advance to the next section until the user approves the wording
6. Multiple revision rounds are expected and by design — this is collaborative wordsmithing

### 5. Remaining sections — standard interview

Walk through the remaining 5 template sections in order. For each section:

1. Explain what the section captures (one sentence)
2. Ask 1-2 bounded questions. Use numbered options where appropriate (3-5 options + "describe your own")
3. Recursive drill-down on vague statements — "for developers" → "which developers? Frontend? Backend? DevOps? Junior? Senior?"
4. Once a clear answer emerges, draft the section content and move to the next

**Section priorities:**

| Priority | Sections | Approach |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Deep interview | Target Audience, Non-Goals | Critical strategic decisions. Spend time here. |
| Moderate interview | Competitive Landscape | Table-only format (Approach / Pros / Cons). No summary paragraphs beneath the table. |
| Light interview | Product North Star, Roadmap Trajectory | Draft with reasonable defaults from prior answers, refine with user. |

**Context dump mode:** If the user pastes existing docs, PRDs, or notes, skip redundant questions and extract answers from the provided context. Label any assumptions explicitly: "I'm assuming X from your notes — correct?"

### 6. Generate VISION.md

Read `assets/vision-template.md`. Fill each section with interview results. Keep it concise — the goal is clarity of direction, not exhaustive documentation.

Write to `VISION.md` at the project root.

### 7. Silent self-check

Before presenting, validate against these anti-patterns:

- **"For everyone" targeting** — Target Audience is too broad or doesn't exclude anyone. Fix: narrow the audience, add explicit exclusions.
- **Solution-first framing** — Problem Statement contains solution language ("we need to build X"). Fix: reframe around the user pain.
- **Technical creep** — Any section contains implementation details (API specs, DB schemas, architecture). Fix: move to a note suggesting `/jim:arch`.

Auto-correct violations before presenting.

### 8. Present and stop

Sections are approved individually during the interview (Problem/Solution via wordsmith mode, others as drafted). This step is the final full-document review.

Show the complete VISION.md to the user.

- **Differential update:** Show a summary of changes by section before applying. Ask: "Want me to apply these changes, or would you like adjustments?"
- **New creation:** Ask: "Want me to write this, or would you like changes first?"

Use Edit for updates, Write for new files. Never auto-apply.

### 9. Redirect technical specifics

If the user brings up implementation details during the interview, redirect: "That sounds like an architecture decision — want to run `/jim:arch` after we finish the vision?"

VISION.md covers product direction only.
