# /jim:meta-skill

Create or update a jim plugin skill (`skills/{name}/SKILL.md`) from an approved spec and plan.

*(The `agent: meta` field in this frontmatter is a jim documentation convention, not a Claude Code routing mechanism.)*

## Process

### 1. Pass three gates before building

Use `$ARGUMENTS` as a hint for the skill name. Search `docs/jim/specs/` for a matching approved spec (`status: approved` in frontmatter), or ask the user which spec to build from.

**Gate 1 — Spec:** Locate an approved spec in `docs/jim/specs/`. If no approved spec exists, spawn `@jim:pm` via the Agent tool to create one. If the pm agent is not available, tell the user to run `/jim:spec` instead.

**Gate 2 — Research Quality:** Read `research.md` from the spec directory. Evaluate it against this 7-point spot-check:

1. **Official Docs** — cites and summarizes Claude Code **skills** documentation
2. **Platform Capabilities** — documents current frontmatter fields, mechanics, behavioral defaults
3. **Prior Art** — includes 1-2+ concrete prior art examples with extracted patterns, not just links
4. **Concrete Examples** — includes at least one real SKILL.md to pattern-match against
5. **Synthesis** — contains a "what to carry forward" section with actionable items
6. **Freshness** — explicitly addresses current mechanics (no stale assumptions)
7. **Spec Alignment** — frontmatter `spec:` field points to the correct spec

If research.md is missing or fails ANY check, spawn `@jim:researcher` via the Agent tool, detailing exactly what is missing or inadequate. After research is fixed, any existing plan.md must be reviewed and updated by `@jim:architect` — the plan may have been built on flawed or missing research. Tell the user to invoke `/jim:plan` after research is complete. If the researcher agent is not available, tell the user to run `/jim:research` instead. Stop execution.

**Gate 3 — Plan:** Locate `plan.md` alongside the spec. If no plan exists, spawn `@jim:architect` via the Agent tool to create one. If the architect agent is not available, tell the user to run `/jim:plan` instead.

After all three gates pass, read spec + plan + research fully. Note the skill name, purpose, acceptance criteria, file manifest, task breakdown, and platform findings before writing anything. The research contains domain knowledge (e.g., Claude Code capabilities, prior art) that directly informs how to build the artifact — do not skip it.

### 2. Check for an existing artifact

Check whether `skills/{name}/SKILL.md` already exists.

- **Exists:** Read it. This is a differential update — summarize the proposed changes to the user before applying them. Use Edit, not Write.
- **Does not exist:** Create the `skills/{name}/` directory and write a new SKILL.md.

### 3. Build the SKILL.md

Write (or update) `skills/{name}/SKILL.md` following the structure below.

**Required frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
name: {skill-name}        # kebab-case — must match directory name exactly
description: >
  {What the skill does AND when to trigger it. Name triggering contexts
  explicitly — this field is the primary invocation mechanism. A vague
  description causes undertriggering. State when NOT to use it too.}
agent: {agent-name}       # which @jim: agent runs this skill (documentation convention only)
argument-hint: "[...]"    # optional: shown in autocomplete
---
```

**Body structure:**
- Opening line: one-sentence purpose
- `$ARGUMENTS` handling (if the skill accepts arguments)
- `## Process` — numbered steps in imperative form
- `## Validation Checklist` (if the skill produces artifacts)
- References to `assets/` or `references/` as needed, with clear guidance on when to read them

**Writing style:**
- Imperative form: "Read the file", "Check for X", "Tell the user to..."
- Explain *why* behind constraints — reasoning beats rigid directives
- Keep lean: remove anything not pulling its weight
- Avoid ALL-CAPS MUSTs; use rationale instead

**Budget:** SKILL.md body ≤ 500 lines. If content would exceed this:
- Templates and output files → `assets/`
- Long reference docs → `references/` (include a table of contents if >300 lines)

### 4. Validate

Work through this checklist before presenting the artifact. Fix failures inline and re-validate.

**Frontmatter**
- [ ] `name` present, kebab-case, matches directory name exactly — this is an open-standard requirement (agentskills.io), not just a jim convention
- [ ] `description` present and includes triggering conditions (when to use, not just what it does)
- [ ] `agent` present and references a valid jim agent name

**Structure**
- [ ] SKILL.md body ≤ 500 lines
- [ ] Any `references/` file >300 lines has a table of contents
- [ ] Instructions use imperative form

**Anti-patterns — any of these is a failure:**
- [ ] No personality soup ("I am here to help you...")
- [ ] No permission creep (tools beyond what the skill actually needs)
- [ ] No instruction shadowing (repeating rules already in `docs/jim/WORKFLOW.md`)
- [ ] No duplicate logic (same instructions in 3+ places → extract to a shared skill)

### 5. Present to user

Show the completed artifact. List what was created or changed. Stop and wait for review — do not proceed to the next phase.
