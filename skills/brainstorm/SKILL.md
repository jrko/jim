# /jim:brainstorm

Capture freeform ideation and exploratory thinking. No rigid structure — the goal is to think freely, not to produce a spec.

*(The `agent: pm` field in this frontmatter is a jim documentation convention, not a Claude Code routing mechanism.)*

## Process

### 1. Get the topic

Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the topic for the brainstorm file. If empty, ask: "What do you want to brainstorm about?"

### 2. Read context (light)

Quickly read `docs/jim/VISION.md` and `docs/jim/ROADMAP.md` if they exist. Don't discuss them — hold them as context so end-of-session routing is informed.

### 3. Create the brainstorm file

Create `docs/jim/brainstorms/{YYYYMMDD}-{topic}.md`. Use today's date and a topic slug (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces). Create the `docs/jim/brainstorms/` directory if it doesn't exist.

Write the initial content:

```markdown
# Brainstorm: {Topic}

*{YYYY-MM-DD}*
```

### 4. Listen and capture

This is the core loop. The PM's role is active listener and synthesizer:

- Ask light clarifying questions to flesh out the thinking. Not a full PM interview — just enough to deepen ideas.
- Capture ideas in whatever structure emerges: bullet lists, prose, questions, pros/cons, diagrams.
- Use Edit to append notes to the brainstorm file as the conversation progresses. Iterative appending — not an end-of-session dump. This prevents data loss and keeps the file as the working document.
- Do not push toward a spec. Do not impose frameworks (no RICE, no OST, no JTBD). Let the user think freely.
- Do not critique or evaluate ideas — capture them. Evaluation happens later if the user decides to spec.

### 5. Detect natural ending

When the conversation reaches a natural stopping point — the user says "I think that's it", "thanks", topic exhaustion, or a long pause — move to routing.

### 6. End-of-session routing

Offer to route synthesized ideas into the formal workflow:

> "Want me to route any of these ideas into the formal workflow? I can create a spec (`/jim:spec`), update the vision (`/jim:vision`), add to the roadmap (`/jim:roadmap`), or run a technical investigation (`/jim:research`)."

This is an offer, not a push. If the user says no, close the session.

If the user says yes to a spec, suggest running `/jim:spec` with the brainstorm file as input context (it can be linked via the `origin:` field).
