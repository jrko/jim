# /jim:roadmap

Create or update the project's ROADMAP.md — a concise Now/Next/Later execution sequence with version anchors.

*(The `agent: pm` field in this frontmatter is a jim documentation convention, not a Claude Code routing mechanism.)*

## Process

### 1. Resolve config

Follow `skills/_shared/resolve-paths.md` before proceeding. Do not reference any `{path.*}` placeholder until the preamble's resolved-paths table has been emitted.

### 2. Seed the conversation

Use `$ARGUMENTS` as a hint for what the user wants to add or update. If empty, start from scratch or review the existing roadmap.

### 3. Read context

Read `{path.vision}` if it exists — for strategic alignment.

If missing, note: "No vision doc yet — consider running `/jim:vision` first to establish product direction. I'll proceed without it." Do not block.

### 4. Search for linkable specs

Glob `{path.specs}/**/*.md` to find existing specs. Grep frontmatter `title:` fields to build a list of linkable candidates. Hold this list — when the user mentions a deliverable that matches a known spec, offer the link.

Do not Read full spec contents — Glob and Grep only. This prevents context overflow in repos with many specs.

### 5. Check for existing roadmap

Read `{path.roadmap}`.

- **Exists:** Differential update. Read existing content. Summarize the current state to the user. Ask what they want to change — add items, move items between buckets, update version anchors, refine objectives.
- **Does not exist:** Fresh creation. Proceed to interview.

### 6. Interview

Walk through the three time-horizon buckets:

- **Now** — "What's actively being worked on? What version or milestone does this map to?"
- **Next** — "What's committed but not started? When does this come after Now?"
- **Later** — "What ideas are on the horizon but not committed?"

For each item the user describes, determine the appropriate detail level:

| Signal | Format |
|--------|--------|
| User describes clear objectives and success criteria | Goal-oriented: Objective / Deliverables / Success Metrics |
| User lists tactical items or early ideas | Simple bullet list |

When a deliverable matches a known spec from step 4, offer: "I found a spec for that — want me to link it? `[003-pm-strategy]({path.specs}/jim/003-pm-strategy/spec.md)`"

### 7. Conciseness enforcement

The roadmap is a strategic communication tool, not a backlog. Push back when it gets too detailed:

- More than 5-7 items per bucket → "This is getting long — want to consolidate, or create specs for the detailed items with `/jim:spec`?"
- Any item description exceeds 3-4 lines → "This is getting detailed — want to create a spec for this? The roadmap works best as a big-picture view."

### 8. Generate the roadmap

First check `.jim/skills/roadmap/assets/roadmap-template.md` — if it exists, use it instead of the built-in. Read `assets/roadmap-template.md`. Fill buckets with interview results. Set "Last updated" to today's date. Keep it concise.

Write to `{path.roadmap}`.

### 9. Silent self-check

Before presenting, validate against these anti-patterns:

- **Feature list, no outcomes** — Items are just feature names without strategic context. Fix: add objectives or group under meaningful themes.
- **Backlog masquerading as roadmap** — More than ~7 items per bucket. Fix: consolidate or defer detail to specs.
- **No version anchors** — Buckets have no version or milestone markers. Fix: ask the user for version targets.

Auto-correct violations before presenting.

### 10. Present and stop

Show the drafted roadmap to the user.

- **Differential update:** Show change summary first. Ask: "Want me to apply these changes?"
- **New creation:** Ask: "Want me to write this, or would you like changes first?"

Use Edit for updates, Write for new files. Never auto-apply.
