# Research: @jim:meta, /jim:meta-skill, /jim:meta-agent

No codebase to research — this is a greenfield plugin component. Instead, this document surveys prior art references and extracts what to carry forward into our implementation.

## Claude Code Documentation Summary

### 1. Skills (`code.claude.com/docs/en/skills`)

**Where skills live:**

| Location | Path | Applies to |
|----------|------|------------|
| Personal | `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | All your projects |
| Project | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | This project only |
| Plugin | `<plugin>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | Where plugin is enabled |

Plugin skills are namespaced: `/jim:skill-name`. They cannot conflict with other levels.

**Frontmatter fields (all optional except by convention):**

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `name` | No | Defaults to directory name. Lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars. |
| `description` | Recommended | Primary trigger mechanism. Omitting uses first paragraph. |
| `argument-hint` | No | Shown in autocomplete, e.g. `[issue-number]` |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | `true` = only user can invoke (manual `/name` only) |
| `user-invocable` | No | `false` = only Claude can invoke (hides from `/` menu) |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Tools Claude can use without approval when skill is active |
| `model` | No | Override model for this skill |
| `context` | No | `fork` = run in isolated subagent |
| `agent` | No | Which subagent type to use when `context: fork` is set |
| `hooks` | No | Lifecycle hooks scoped to this skill |

**Key mechanics:**
- Skill `description` is always in context (so Claude knows what's available). Full SKILL.md body loads only when invoked.
- `$ARGUMENTS` substitution — replaced with what user typed after `/skill-name`
- `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` — path to the skill's directory (useful for referencing bundled scripts)
- `context: fork` + `agent:` runs the skill in an isolated subagent context — the skill content becomes the task prompt
- `allowed-tools` grants the listed tools without per-use approval when the skill is active

**Progressive disclosure (official):**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Required. Keep under 500 lines.
├── assets/            # Templates, files used in output
├── references/        # Long-form docs loaded as needed
└── scripts/           # Executable scripts (run, not loaded)
```

**Invocation control:**
| Frontmatter | User can invoke | Claude can invoke |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| (default) | Yes | Yes |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | Yes | No |
| `user-invocable: false` | No | Yes |

---

### 2. Sub-agents (`code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents`)

**Where agents live:**

| Location | Scope | Priority |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `--agents` CLI flag | Current session | 1 (highest) |
| `.claude/agents/` | Current project | 2 |
| `~/.claude/agents/` | All projects | 3 |
| `<plugin>/agents/` | Where plugin enabled | 4 (lowest) |

When the same name exists at multiple levels, higher priority wins. Project agents override plugin agents.

**Frontmatter fields:**

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `name` | Yes | Unique identifier, lowercase + hyphens |
| `description` | Yes | When Claude should delegate to this agent |
| `tools` | No | Allowlist. Inherits all if omitted. |
| `disallowedTools` | No | Denylist. Removed from inherited/specified. |
| `model` | No | `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku`, or `inherit`. **Defaults to `inherit`.** |
| `permissionMode` | No | `default`, `acceptEdits`, `dontAsk`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan` |
| `maxTurns` | No | Max agentic turns before stopping |
| `skills` | No | Skills to preload into agent context at startup (full content injected) |
| `mcpServers` | No | MCP servers available to this agent |
| `hooks` | No | Lifecycle hooks scoped to this agent |
| `memory` | No | Persistent memory: `user`, `project`, or `local` |
| `background` | No | `true` = always run as background task |
| `isolation` | No | `worktree` = run in isolated git worktree |

**Key mechanics:**
- Markdown body becomes the **system prompt** — agents receive only this plus basic env details (working dir, etc.). They do NOT inherit the full Claude Code system prompt.
- `model` **defaults to `inherit`** (not `sonnet`). Explicitly set `model: sonnet` or `model: opus` if you want a specific model.
- `skills` field preloads full skill content at startup. Agents do NOT inherit skills from the parent conversation — must list explicitly.
- `memory` gives the agent a persistent directory (`MEMORY.md` + topic files) that survives across sessions.
- **Agent tool for subagent delegation:** Agents can spawn other agents programmatically by including `Agent` in their `tools` field. Use `Agent(name1, name2)` to restrict which subagents can be spawned. Subagents start with fresh context (only the prompt passed via the Agent tool, not the parent's conversation). **Key constraint:** subagents cannot nest — only one level of delegation is supported (parent → child, not parent → child → grandchild).

**⚠ Important for jim:**
The `agent:` field in jim skill frontmatter (e.g. `agent: meta`) is **NOT a native Claude Code skill field**. In official docs, `agent:` only exists in skills when used with `context: fork`. Jim uses it as a **documentation convention** — it records which agent runs the skill, but Claude Code does not use it for routing. Routing happens because the skill's instructions direct Claude to the right agent.

## Prior Art Survey

### Agent Skills Open Standard (agentskills.io)

**What it is:** An open standard for AI skills, originally developed by Anthropic and released December 2025. Now adopted by 30+ tools: Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, OpenAI Codex CLI, Roo Code, JetBrains Junie, and others.

**This is the baseline Claude Code builds on top of.**

**Canonical SKILL.md spec (minimum viable):**

| Field | Required | Constraints |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | 1–64 chars, lowercase + hyphens, **must match directory name exactly** |
| `description` | Yes | 1–1024 chars. Must answer both *what it does* AND *when to use it* |
| `license` | No | License name or bundled file reference |
| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars; environment requirements |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value map (author, version, etc.) |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited; experimental |

**Validation CLI:** `skills-ref validate ./my-skill` (`github.com/agentskills/agentskills`)

**Implication for jim:** Jim's skill format is a superset of this standard (Claude Code adds more fields). The `name`-matches-directory constraint is enforced at the open standard level — jim's validator must check this.

---

### Claude Code Internal Prompts (Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts)

**What it is:** A GitHub repo containing Claude Code's own internal system prompts, including sub-agent prompts (Plan, Explore, Task), skill creation logic, and CLAUDE.md handling. Reference-grade source for understanding exactly how Claude Code orchestrates agents and skills internally.

**Key reference:** `github.com/Piebald-AI/claude-code-system-prompts` — useful if we need to understand edge cases in how Claude Code loads/routes skills and agents.

---

### Community Skill Collections

| Resource | What it contains |
|----------|-----------------|
| `github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills` | 500+ skills compatible with Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini CLI, Cursor |
| `github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code` | Curated index: skills, hooks, agents, plugins, CLAUDE.md templates |
| `github.com/rahulvrane/awesome-claude-agents` | Claude Code subagent collection |
| `skillsmp.com` | Cross-platform skills marketplace |

**Implication for jim:** The jim-produced skills and agents should be compatible with the open standard so they could theoretically be published to these collections.

---

### CrewAI — Agent Role Definition Pattern

**What it is:** Most prominent multi-agent framework. Defines agents with three required fields:

```yaml
agent_name:
  role: >
    Agent's professional title and domain
  goal: >
    Specific objective guiding decisions
  backstory: >
    Background context shaping personality/reasoning
```

**Borrowable insight:** When writing agent `description` fields, covering all three axes — what the agent IS (role), what it's optimizing for (goal), and the context it reasons from (backstory) — produces better routing than flat task descriptions. Jim agent descriptions should aim for this depth.

---

### meta-agent (DannyMac180/meta-agent)

**What it is:** Interview-driven agent creator. Guided questions → JSON schema spec → validate → generate agent. The closest existing tool to what `@jim:meta` does.

**Pattern:** Capture intent through structured interview → generate from spec → validate before output. This is exactly jim's spec → plan → build → validate flow. Validates our approach.

---

### Patterns Worth Borrowing (Summary)

| Pattern | Source | Application to jim |
|---------|--------|--------------------|
| `name` must match directory name | agentskills.io (open standard) | Required validation check in both skills |
| `description` must answer what + when | agentskills.io | Validation: check description has triggering conditions |
| Two required fields: name + description | agentskills.io | Minimum viable frontmatter |
| role/goal/backstory triad for descriptions | CrewAI | Guide for writing richer agent descriptions |
| Validate before output | ROMA, skill-creator, meta-agent | ✓ Already in our spec |
| Interview → spec → generate | meta-agent | ✓ Jim's full workflow |

## Prior Art Review

### 1. Anthropic Skill Creator

A complete skill-building pipeline: intent capture → write SKILL.md → run test evals → browser-based review → iterate → description optimization → package.

**Key ideas:**

**Skill anatomy:**
```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              ← required
└── Bundled Resources/
    ├── scripts/          ← executable code, runs without loading into context
    ├── references/       ← docs loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/           ← templates, icons, files used in output
```

**Progressive disclosure (3 levels):**
1. Metadata (name + description) — always in context, ~100 words
2. SKILL.md body — in context when skill triggers, ≤500 lines
3. Bundled resources — loaded as needed, unlimited

**Description is the primary trigger mechanism:**
- Must state *when* to use, not just *what* it does
- Should be "pushy" — explicitly name the contexts that should trigger it
- Bad: `"How to build a dashboard."` → Good: `"How to build a dashboard. Use whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, or wants to display company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'"`

**Writing style:**
- Imperative form in instructions
- Explain the **why** behind rules, not just the rule itself — LLMs respond better to reasoning than to rigid MUSTs
- Avoid ALL-CAPS MUSTs where a clear rationale would work better
- Keep it lean — remove things not pulling their weight
- Use theory of mind: transmit understanding, not just directives

**Domain organization pattern:**
```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md              ← workflow + selection logic
└── references/
    ├── aws.md
    ├── gcp.md
    └── azure.md          ← Claude reads only the relevant one
```

**What we're NOT adopting from skill-creator (out of scope for v1):**
- Eval loop (subagents running with/without skill, benchmarking)
- Browser-based eval viewer
- Description optimization scripts (`run_loop.py`)
- Packaging (`.skill` files)
- Python scripts infrastructure

---

### 2. aitmpl.com Agent Development

Structured standards for agent component creation.

**Identifier rules:**
- 3–50 characters, lowercase with hyphens only
- Must start and end with alphanumeric characters

**Description requirements:**
- Must include triggering conditions
- Must include `<example>` blocks showing concrete usage
- Each example must have: user request, assistant response, commentary explaining appropriateness

**Frontmatter fields:** name, description, model, tools, version

**System prompt standards:**
- Second-person voice: `"You are..."`
- Required sections: core responsibilities, analysis process, quality standards, output format, edge case handling

**Least privilege:** agents receive only the tools they actually need

---

### 3. meta-architect-skill (existing in earlier predecessor to jim)

The base standards for `.claude/` ecosystem components. Already well-defined — jim should align with these, not contradict them.

**What it enforces:**

| Check | Threshold |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontmatter | name, description, tools, model — all required |
| Token budget | agents <800 tokens, skills <500 lines |
| Naming | kebab-case; `name` field must match filename exactly |
| Tool permissions | Only tools actually used |
| Command voice | Imperative, not "please try to" |

**Anti-patterns:**
- Personality Soup: "I am an AI assistant here to help"
- Permission Creep: Write/Bash for read-only agents
- Instruction Shadowing: repeating rules already in CLAUDE.md
- Duplicate Logic: same instructions in 3+ agents → extract to shared skill
- Missing Frontmatter: every component needs it for discoverability

---

## Synthesis: What to Carry Forward

These are the items from prior art that add value beyond what jim's existing WORKFLOW.md already specifies.

### For SKILL.md standards

| Item | Source | Why it matters |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Description must include triggering conditions | Skill-creator, aitmpl | Description is the *only* thing Claude sees when deciding whether to invoke a skill. Vague descriptions cause undertriggering. |
| Description should be "pushy" — name the contexts explicitly | Skill-creator | Prevents undertriggering, which is the most common failure mode. |
| Imperative form in instructions | Skill-creator | Consistent, direct, easier to follow. |
| Explain the *why*, not just the *what* | Skill-creator | LLMs use reasoning; understanding intent produces better results than rigid rules. |
| `references/` files >300 lines need a ToC | Skill-creator | Progressive disclosure — help Claude find what it needs without loading everything. |
| Domain variants go in `references/` subdirectory | Skill-creator | Keeps SKILL.md lean; Claude loads only the relevant variant. |

### From Claude Code official docs

| Item | Source | Why it matters |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Agent `model` defaults to `inherit`, not `sonnet` | Official docs | Must explicitly set `model: sonnet` in agent frontmatter — don't assume it defaults. |
| Plugin agents have lowest priority (4) | Official docs | Project `.claude/agents/` overrides plugin agents of the same name. |
| Agent markdown body = full system prompt | Official docs | Agents receive ONLY this + basic env. No Claude Code system prompt inheritance. Must be self-contained. |
| Skill `description` always in context; body loads on invocation | Official docs | Description is the trigger surface. Body is the execution surface. Keep both tight. |
| Jim's `agent:` field in skill frontmatter is documentation-only | Official docs | Not a native Claude Code routing mechanism. Works as a convention/metadata only. |
| `$ARGUMENTS` substitution in skills | Official docs | Enables `/jim:meta-skill my-skill-name` to pass the name directly to the skill. |
| `skills` field in agents preloads full content at startup | Official docs | Alternative to relying on skill auto-triggering — guarantees the skill is in context. |
| `Agent` tool enables programmatic subagent delegation | Official docs | Agents with `Agent` in `tools` can spawn other agents. Use `Agent(pm, architect)` to scope. Subagents cannot nest (one level only). |

### For Agent standards

| Item | Source | Why it matters |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Second-person voice: "You are..." | aitmpl | Consistent persona framing across all jim agents. |
| Required sections: responsibilities, process, quality standards, output format, edge case handling | aitmpl | Ensures agents are complete — not just "what you do" but "how you do it" and "what done looks like." |
| `<example>` blocks in descriptions | aitmpl | Makes triggering deterministic; shows Claude exactly when to activate the agent. |
| Explain the *why* behind constraints | Skill-creator | Same as skills — reasoning beats directives. |

### Validation checklist for @jim:meta

When `@jim:meta` validates a produced artifact, it should check:

**Skills:**
- [ ] Frontmatter present: name, description, agent
- [ ] `name` matches directory name (kebab-case)
- [ ] SKILL.md ≤ 500 lines
- [ ] `agent:` references a valid jim agent
- [ ] Description includes triggering conditions (not just what, but when)
- [ ] assets/ and/or references/ created if overflow
- [ ] references/ files >300 lines have a ToC
- [ ] Instructions use imperative form
- [ ] No anti-patterns (personality soup, permission creep, instruction shadowing, duplicate logic)

**Agents:**
- [ ] Frontmatter present: name, description, skills (if applicable), tools, model
- [ ] `name` matches filename (kebab-case)
- [ ] Body ≤ 800 tokens
- [ ] Second-person voice ("You are...")
- [ ] Has sections: responsibilities, process, quality standards/constraints, output format
- [ ] Description includes triggering conditions + at least one example
- [ ] Tools list follows least privilege
- [ ] No anti-patterns

## What We're Building On vs. Reinventing

| Component | Build on | Not reinventing |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| SKILL.md structure + progressive disclosure | Skill-creator (identical model) | ✓ Don't redesign |
| Agent frontmatter format | meta-architect-skill (already our standard) | ✓ Don't redesign |
| Jim-specific `agent:` field in skill frontmatter | jim WORKFLOW.md (our addition) | New, not in prior art |
| Spec-first workflow before building | jim WORKFLOW.md (our addition) | New — skill-creator skips this |
| Structural validation before handoff | Our decision | Skill-creator uses eval loop instead; we do structural only in v1 |
| Differential update (refine, don't overwrite) | jim WORKFLOW.md (our addition) | New — not in prior art |
