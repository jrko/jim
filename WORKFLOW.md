# Development Workflow: The "Jim" Plugin

This document defines the agentic development workflow for projects using Jim. "Jim" is a **Claude Code plugin** that provides a command-driven SDLC through namespaced skills and specialized agents. You talk to Jim like a person: `/jim:spec`, `/jim:plan`, `/jim:build`.

### The Feedback Loop

This is not waterfall. Any downstream phase can send you back upstream:

- During **plan** you discover the spec is wrong → update the spec.
- During **build** you discover the plan missed something → update the plan.
- During **build** a failing test reveals a spec gap → update the spec, then the plan.

**No ghost tasks:** if a code change is needed that isn't in the plan, the plan must be updated before the code is touched. The artifacts are living documents, not approval gates you pass through once.

### The Research Engine

Research is not a gated phase; it is an agile service that grounds the SDLC in reality.

1. **Pre-Spec (Exploratory):** PM invokes `/jim:research` to explore libraries or codebase
   feasibility before committing to a spec.
2. **In-Plan (Autonomous):** If `/jim:plan` is run and no `research.md` exists (or it's
   insufficient), the Architect automatically spawns the Researcher.
3. **The Feedback Loop:**
   - **Research → Spec:** If research reveals a requirement is technically impossible, it
     signals the PM to update the spec.
   - **Research → Plan:** If research is updated after a plan exists, it signals the
     Architect to re-validate the implementation anchors.

## Artifacts

### Project Artifacts

| Artifact | Location | What It Is | Managed By |
|----------|----------|------------|------------|
| Vision | `VISION.md` | Big picture — problem statement, value prop, target audience, competitive landscape | `/jim:vision` |
| Architecture | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | Technical foundation — codemap, system diagram, tech stack, data structures, architectural invariants | `/jim:arch` |
| Roadmap | `ROADMAP.md` | Execution sequence — milestones, phase breakdowns, links to numbered specs with status | `/jim:roadmap` |
| Spec | `docs/specs/{group}/{00X}-{name}/spec.md` | Work definition — requirements, acceptance criteria, spec type (feature/bug/refactor) | `/jim:spec` |
| Plan | `docs/specs/{group}/{00X}-{name}/plan.md` | Implementation path — codebase research, atomic tasks, dependencies | `/jim:plan` |
| Security Review | `docs/specs/{group}/{00X}-{name}/security.md` | Design-time security analysis — threats, findings, recommended routes | `/jim:sec` |
| Debug Report | `docs/debug/{YYYYMMDD}-{topic}.md` | Diagnosis — error analysis, root cause, references to affected specs | `/jim:debug` |
| Backlog | `BACKLOG.md` | Consolidated deferred work — out-of-scope items, unresolved ideas, cross-cutting themes | `/jim:backlog` |
| Brainstorm | `docs/brainstorms/{YYYYMMDD}-{topic}.md` | Exploratory notes — ideas, risks, options, may feed into specs | `/jim:brainstorm` |
| Config | `.jim/config.md` | Project-level configuration — paths, workflow gates, spec ID format | `/jim:config` |

### Plugin Artifacts (Jim developing Jim)

> **Not yet implemented.** Jim does not currently support updating itself from within a host project. To develop jim, work directly in the jim repository. Jim's own docs follow the same structure as any project.

---

## Philosophy

**Spec-Driven Development:** We separate thinking from doing. Requirements, research, and plans are defined and approved before implementation begins.

**Strategic Alignment:** Every spec traces back to the project's vision (why), architecture (how), and roadmap (when).

**Test-Driven Development:** Following Kent Beck's TDD — one task, one failing test, minimum code to pass, tidy, commit, next. Structural changes (refactors) are always separate from behavioral changes.

**Human-in-the-Loop:** Agents STOP and wait for approval after completing each phase gate or atomic task. No autonomous multi-phase execution.

**Differential Updates:** Running any `/jim:` command on an existing artifact refines it based on new context, never overwrites blindly.

## Plugin Architecture

"Jim" is a Claude Code plugin. All skills are namespaced as `/jim:{verb}`, all agents as `@jim:{role}`.

### Agents

| Agent | Role | Used By |
|-------|------|---------|
| `@jim:pm` | Product strategy, specs, vision, roadmap, backlog | `/jim:spec`, `/jim:vision`, `/jim:roadmap`, `/jim:backlog`, `/jim:brainstorm` |
| `@jim:architect` | Technical planning, architecture | `/jim:plan`, `/jim:arch` |
| `@jim:researcher` | Codebase investigation and technical landscape research | `/jim:research`, invoked by PM or architect |
| `@jim:security` | Design-time security analysis and threat review | `/jim:sec` |
| `@jim:coder` | TDD implementation, debugging | `/jim:build`, `/jim:debug` |
| `@jim:reviewer` | Quality gate *(not yet implemented)* | TBD |
| `@jim:meta` | Plugin development — builds skills, agents, and config | `/jim:meta-skill`, `/jim:meta-agent`, `/jim:config` |

### Agent ↔ Skill Composition

Agents declare which skills they compose in their frontmatter. Skills declare which agent runs them.

```yaml
# jim/agents/pm.md
---
name: pm
description: Product manager. Defines specs and maintains strategic alignment.
skills:
  - spec
  - vision
  - roadmap
  - brainstorm
  - backlog
---
```

```yaml
# jim/agents/architect.md
---
name: architect
description: Technical architect. Plans implementation and maintains
  the technical architecture. Delegates codebase investigation to
  @jim:researcher subagent.
skills:
  - plan
  - arch
---
```

```yaml
# jim/agents/researcher.md
---
name: researcher
description: Codebase investigator. Explores existing code patterns,
  integration points, and blast radius. Read-only. Reports findings
  back to the architect.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---
```

```yaml
# jim/agents/coder.md
---
name: coder
description: Developer. Builds via TDD and debugs failures.
skills:
  - build
  - debug
---
```

```yaml
# jim/agents/reviewer.md (not yet implemented)
---
name: reviewer
description: Code reviewer. Quality and security gate.
skills:
  - review
---
```

```yaml
# jim/agents/meta.md
---
name: meta
description: Plugin developer. Creates and updates jim skills and agents
  from specs. Reads workflow.md for SDLC context and enforces plugin
  conventions (frontmatter, naming, progressive disclosure).
skills:
  - meta-skill
  - meta-agent
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
---
```

Skills specify their agent in frontmatter:

```yaml
# jim/skills/spec/SKILL.md
---
name: spec
description: Create, update, or validate feature/bug/refactor specs.
  Use when the user wants to scope work, write a spec, or define requirements.
agent: pm
---
```

```yaml
# jim/skills/arch/SKILL.md
---
name: arch
description: Create or update the project ARCHITECTURE.md following
  the architecture.md standard. Use when discussing tech stack, system
  design, codemap, or architectural decisions.
agent: architect
---
```

```yaml
# jim/skills/meta-skill/SKILL.md
---
name: meta-skill
description: Create or update a jim plugin skill. Reads workflow.md
  and spec to generate SKILL.md with proper frontmatter, directory
  structure (assets/, references/), and agent binding.
agent: meta
---
```

---

## The Lifecycle in Detail

### `/jim:spec`

**Purpose:** Turn a rough idea into a clear, actionable spec.

**Process:**
1. Describe your idea, bug report, or refactor motivation
2. PM determines spec type (`feature`, `bug`, `refactor`) and asks clarifying questions (1-2 at a time)
3. Checks alignment against VISION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
4. Generates spec using template from `spec/assets/spec-template.md`
5. You review and approve or request changes

**Output:** `docs/specs/{group}/{00X}-{name}/spec.md`

**Gate:** Human approves the spec. Status changes from `draft` to `approved`.

### `/jim:plan`

**Purpose:** Research the codebase and create an implementation plan.

**Process:**
1. Reads the approved spec
2. Delegates codebase investigation to `@jim:researcher` subagent — integration points, fault locations (bugs), blast radius (refactors)
3. Reviews research findings
4. Checks ARCHITECTURE.md for architectural constraints
5. Breaks work into atomic, checkable tasks
6. You review and approve

**Output:** `docs/specs/{group}/{00X}-{name}/plan.md`

**Gate:** Human approves the plan. Build cannot begin without it.

### `/jim:build`

**Purpose:** Implement the plan using TDD, one task at a time.

**Process:** For each task in `plan.md`:
1. **Red** — Write a failing test (bug: reproduction test; refactor: skip if covered)
2. **Green** — Write minimum code to make it pass
3. **Refactor** — Tidy structural changes (separate from behavioral)
4. Run all tests, confirm green
5. Commit with conventional message
6. Mark task complete, move to next

**Tidy First:** Structural changes (renames, extractions, moves) are never mixed with behavioral changes (new functionality) in the same commit.

**Gate:** All tests pass. `./pre-commit.sh` is green.

### `/jim:review` *(not yet implemented)*

**Purpose:** Quality and security review before PR.

### `/jim:ship` *(not yet implemented)*

**Purpose:** Create PR, deploy, update roadmap status.

## Building Jim with Jim

Jim can develop itself through its own SDLC. Skills and agents for the plugin are specs like any other — the "feature" is a plugin component.

```
/jim:spec          → spec out what a skill should do (reads workflow.md)
/jim:plan          → plan the skill's structure and content (optional)
/jim:meta-skill    → build the skill from spec + plan
/jim:meta-agent    → build the agent from spec + plan
```

Jim's own specs live in `docs/specs/jim/` as a group. Jim's strategic docs (`VISION.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`) live at the project root.

---

## Skipping Phases

Not every change needs the full lifecycle:

| Change Type | Start At | Skip |
|-------------|----------|------|
| New feature | `/jim:spec` | — |
| Bug | `/jim:spec` | — |
| Refactor | `/jim:spec` | — |
| Exploratory research | `/jim:research` | Spec, Plan |
| Strategic change | `/jim:vision` or `/jim:arch` | — |
| Hotfix (urgent) | `/jim:build` | Spec, Plan |
| Typo/docs | Direct commit | Everything |

---

## Rules of Engagement

1. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Agents STOP after each phase gate or atomic task. No autonomous multi-phase execution.

2. **Differential Updates:** Every `/jim:` command creates if the artifact doesn't exist, refines based on new context if it does. Never overwrites blindly.

3. **No Ghost Tasks:** If a code change isn't in the plan, update the plan first.

4. **Strategic Alignment:** Specs reference the vision and architecture. The PM checks this during `/jim:spec`.

5. **Verification Loops:** Every code change is verified by test, linter, or type checker.

6. **Progressive Disclosure:** SKILL.md stays under 500 lines. Templates in `assets/`, reference docs in `references/`.

7. **Configurable Gates:** `.jim/config.md` can enforce prerequisites before a phase runs. `workflow.require-research` and `workflow.require-security` are off by default — enable them to make `/jim:plan` or `/jim:build` stop when the prerequisite artifact is missing. `workflow.require-plan-approval` is on by default — `/jim:build` stops unless the plan is approved.

---

## Configuration and Overlay

Jim is configurable per-project via `.jim/config.md`. All skills and agents read the file at the start of every invocation; omitted keys use defaults, and the file is optional.

- **Paths** — redirect where jim reads strategic docs and writes specs, brainstorms, debug reports
- **Spec ID format** — padding width and optional prefix (e.g., `FE-001`)
- **Workflow gates** — enforce research, security review, or plan approval as prerequisites
- **Overlay** — place custom templates under `.jim/skills/{name}/assets/` or `references/` to override built-in files (file presence wins, no config key required)

Run `/jim:config` to scaffold or update the config interactively. See [`CONFIG.md`](CONFIG.md) for the full schema.
